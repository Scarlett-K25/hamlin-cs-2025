	<h2 id="p3">How Coral Reefs Help Our Ecosystem</h2>
	<h3>Habitat</h3><p>Coral reefs are some of the most diverse and valuable ecosystems on Earth. Home to over 4,000 species of fish, corals, and other marine life, coral reefs cover only 1% of the world’s oceans, but provide habitat for at least 25% of the world’s marine life, with many reef species still to be discovered. </p><h3>Economic</h3><p>Healthy coral reefs provide food for coastal and inland communities. Since more than half of all U.S. fisheries species depend on coral reefs for a portion of their life cycles, coral reefs are essential in supporting commercial and recreational fisheries. NOAA estimates the commercial value of U.S. fisheries from coral reefs to be over $100 million. </p><p> Coral reefs support jobs and businesses through tourism and recreation. Local economies receive billions of dollars from visitors to coral reefs through diving tours, recreational fishing trips, hotels, restaurants, and other businesses located near reefs ecosystems. </p> <h3>Medicinal</h3> <p>Corals are considered key to finding new medicines. Many drugs are now being developed from compounds discovered in coral reef animals and plants as possible cures for cancer, arthritis, bacterial infections, viruses, and other diseases. It is believed that coral reefs still have a lot of untapped medicinal potential and there is much research yet to be done. </p><h3>Protection</h3><p> Coral reefs also protect shorelines by reducing the impact from waves, storms, and floods. This helps prevent loss of life, property damage, and erosion. When reefs are damaged or destroyed, coastal communities can suffer increased damage from severe storms, and even normal wave action. Millions of people live in U.S. coastal areas near coral reefs. Some coastal development is needed to provide infrastructure for coastal residents (i.e. roads, bridges) as well as the coastal tourism industry. Coral reefs help to protect these coastal communities, and their economies, naturally. </p><h3>Landmass Creation</h3><p>Coral reefs also have a hand in building beaches. Much of the sand on beaches near coral reefs is made of broken-down coral skeletons. Some reef creatures actually produce sand as a result of consuming corals. For example, parrotfish bite and scrape algae off of rocks and dead corals, grind up the inedible calcium-carbonate of the coral skeletons in their guts, and then excrete it as sand. Parrotfish can produce hundreds of pounds of white sand each year. </p><h3>Water Filtration</h3><p> Coral reefs are also home to important filter feeders, like sponges, that filter toxins and contaminants out of the oceans, and support large amounts of plant life that take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Coral reefs are able to support diverse ecosystems, filter the water, and create oxygen when they have clean, clear, and cool water to support them.
