	<h2 id="p4">Global Warming's Impact on Coral Reefs</h2>
	<p>Most coral reefs occur in shallow water near shore. As a result, they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of human activities, both through direct exploitation of reef resources, and through indirect impacts from adjacent human activities on land and in the coastal zone. Many of the human activities that degrade coral reefs are inextricably woven into the social, cultural, and economic fabric of regional coastal communities.</p>

	<h2>What would happen if there were no more coral reefs?</h2>
	<p><strong>25% of marine life would lose their habitat.</strong>
		Despite covering less than 1% of the ocean, coral reefs provide essential habitat for 25% of all marine life. That’s well over 1 million species that live in and depend upon coral reefs around the world. For these creatures, the reef provides essential food, shelter and the spawning grounds needed for their species’ survival. If their homes disappeared, marine biodiversity would suffer immensely. And, like a domino effect, many fish, turtles and other creatures would disappear. 
		<br><strong>
		Coastal fishing industries would collapse.</strong>
		According to the United Nations, around one billion people globally depend on coral reefs for their food and livelihoods. Their disappearance would be catastrophic; resulting in hundreds of millions of people around the world losing their main source of food and income. On top of this, the shortage of seafood in diets would inevitably put pressure on other land-based farming industries who would be required to make up for the shortfall.
		<br><strong>
		Coastal tourism economies would shrink.</strong>
		Coral reefs attract tourists to over 100 countries and territories worldwide. According to a 2017 study, coral reef tourism generates an estimated $36 billion in revenue every single year. Without spectacular reefs to visit, these tourist numbers would fall sharply and the impact would hit local businesses very hard.
		<br><strong>
		Coastlines would succumb to environmental effects.</strong>
		Coral reefs protect our coastlines by providing a natural buffer against powerful waves and extreme weather. Without them, shorelines would be vulnerable to erosion and rising sea levels would push coast-dwelling communities out of their homes. The cost of building sea walls for the same level of protection could be in the trillions.
		<br><strong>
		Medical breakthroughs would grind to a halt.</strong>
		By researching the corals’ natural chemical defenses, scientists are able to develop medicines to treat all sorts: from cancer and arthritis, to Alzheimer’s and heart disease.
		<br><strong>
		The ocean bed would eventually become dominated by algae. </strong>As the skeletal structures of the limestone reefs slowly break away, microbial life would soak up the sun’s energy, producing slime.
		<br><strong>
		There’d be less oxygen.</strong>
		Around 50-80% of oxygen production on our planet comes from our oceans. Most of this oxygen is produced by plankton and other photosynthesising bacteria, which the coral reefs support. In turn, this oxygen is consumed by marine life and by humans too in the air we breathe.

	<h2>What can we do to help?</h2>

	<p>
<strong>When visiting coral reefs,</strong>
practice safe and responsible diving and snorkeling.  Avoid touching reefs or anchoring your boat on the reef. Contact with the reef will damage the delicate coral animals, and anchoring on the reef can kill corals, so look for sandy bottom or use moorings, if available.
<br>
<strong>Take a reef-friendly approach to sun protection. </strong> Some ingredients in sunscreen can be harmful to or even kill corals. Inform yourself of safer choices for coral. For a better effect, cut down on sunscreen use by wearing a long-sleeved shirt or rash guard to prevent sunburn.
<br><strong>Recycle and dispose of trash properly. </strong> Marine debris can be harmful to coral reefs. When disposing of trash, do it properly in bins, to avoid trash being blown or washed away into waterways and oceans. On beaches, make sure you leave no trash behind, and never throw or leave any cigarette butts in the sand.  You can help keep your rivers and streams clean by volunteering to pick up trash in your community.
<br>
<strong>
Use environmentally-friendly modes of transportation. </strong> Instead of driving a car, try to walk, bike, or use public transport (like buses and trains) more often. If you are planning to buy a car, choose a fuel-efficient vehicle like a hybrid or electric car. Using these cleaner transportation methods can help reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses that are emitted into the atmosphere. These emissions contribute to ocean acidification and increased ocean temperature.
<br><strong>
Save energy at home and at work. </strong> You can save energy at home by turning off lights and electronic devices when not using them and opting to buy energy-efficient appliances such as Energy Star-certified appliances. At work, try to turn the lights and your computer off when you leave.
Be conscious when buying aquarium fish.  Avoid purchasing living coral and if you buy a marine aquarium fish, make sure that it has been collected in a sustainable manner.
<br><strong>Spread the word! </strong> Learn more about coral reefs and educate your community. You can share this information with your family, your friends, your local schools and businesses, and you can always contact your local representatives to see what your state is doing to protect water quality and coral reefs.
