	<h2 id="p2">Types of Coral Reefs</h2>
	<p>There are three main types of coral reefs.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><h2>Fringing</h2><p>A fringing reef is one of the three main types of coral reef. It is distinguished from the other main types, barrier reefs and atolls, in that it has either an entirely shallow backreef zone (also known as a lagoon) or doesn't have one at all. If a fringing reef grows directly from the shoreline, then there is no backreef. In other cases, fringing reefs may grow hundreds of yards from shore and contain extensive backreef areas. Charles Darwin believed that fringing reefs are the first kind of reefs to form around a landmass in a long-term reef growth process. The largest fringing coral reef in the world is the Ningaloo Reef, stretching to around 160 miles along the coastline of Western Australia.</p><br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/EilatFringingReef.jpg" alt="a fringing reef"><br><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3797096">Image Source: Wikepedia</a></li>
		<li><h2>Barrier</h2><p>Barrier reefs are reefs that are separated from the main coast by a deep channel or lagoon. Barrier reefs with shallow lagoons can sometimes look similar to fringing reefs, but are distinct because of their tendency to have deeper lagoons. Barrier reefs typically form in open water rather than immediately adjacent to a shoreline, and it is only through a change in sea-level that they become associated with a shoreline. Barrier reefs are rare, but include some of the world's most famous reefs: the Australian Great Barrier Reef and Belize's Barrier Reef.

		<li><h2>Atoll</h2><p>An atoll is a ring-shaped island, including a coral rim that encircles a lagoon. There may be coral islands on the rim. Atolls are located in warm tropical or subtropical parts of the oceans and seas where corals can develop. Most of the approximately 440 atolls in the world are in the Pacific Ocean. There are many theoretic models of atoll reef formation. According to Charles Darwin's subsidence model, the formation of an atoll is explained by the sinking of a volcanic island around which a coral fringing reef has formed. Over geologic time, the volcanic island becomes extinct and eroded as it subsides completely beneath the surface of the ocean. As the volcanic island subsides, the coral fringing reef becomes a barrier reef that is detached from the island. Eventually, reef and the small coral islets on top of it are all that is left of the original island, and a lagoon has taken the place of the former volcano.</p><img src="https://www.islandexpeditions.com/sites/default/files/blue-hole-belize_0.jpg" alt="an atoll reef"><br><a href="https://www.islandexpeditions.com/belize-vacations-blog/exploring-atolls-belize-what-atoll">Image Source: Island Expeditions</a>
